# CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline setup for automating the build, test, and deployment processes of an application. The pipeline ensures efficient and reliable software delivery by leveraging automation tools.

## Features

- **Automated Build Process**: Ensures that code changes are compiled and built seamlessly.
- **Automated Testing**: Runs unit and integration tests to verify the integrity of the application.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploys successful builds to production or staging environments.
- **Containerization**: Uses Docker for creating consistent deployment environments.
- **Version Control Integration**: Works with GitHub/GitLab to trigger pipeline runs on code commits.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD Tools**: [Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD/CircleCI]
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/Ansible (if applicable)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub/GitLab
- **Testing Framework**: [JUnit/PyTest/Mocha/etc.]
- **Cloud Provider**: [AWS/GCP/Azure] (if applicable)
